# FI-FSL
The basic codes of FI-FSL.

See runcode.txt for more details about how to train and test.

Need to create "dataset", "checkpoint" and "features" folders.

Part of the dataset(for research only!) used in the paper DFSPD can be obtained by writing an e-mail request to authors. 
*The QFSD in the codes is the previous name of this dataset.
